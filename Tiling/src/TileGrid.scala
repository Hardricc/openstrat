/** A TileGrid is a description of an abstract TileGrid. It contains no data for the elements of any particular TileGrid. The Data for TileGrids is
 *  stored in flat arrays. The TileGrid gives the dimensions of a tileGrid. It has methods to interpret the data in flat Arrays created for that
 *  TileGrid specification. It has methods to map the elements of an Array to the the 2 dimensional geometry of the Tile Grid. On its own a TileGrid
 *  can produce the outlines of the grid, coordinates vector positions and other pure mathematical data. Combined with a simple function it can for
 *  example produce a Chess board. Combined with a 64 length array it can produce a Chess board position. For anything but the most simple games, you
 *  will probably want multiple arrays to describe the game state. The terrain for example may remain invariant, so the terrain data does not need to
 *  be reproduced with every move.
 *
 *  A TileGrid is for use cases where the proportions of the Grid predetermine the proportions of the visual representation, as opposed to a use case
 *  where the proportions of the enclosing space are a factor in determining the proportions of the grid. For example the various grid layouts of the
 *  Stars on the American flag. */
