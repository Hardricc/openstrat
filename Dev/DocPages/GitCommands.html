<ul><li> git (for transfering files from the master repository to your local machine and back again)</li>
<li>sbt (this is one way to compile & build the project)</li></ul>

<h3>Git</h3>

<p>clone (used when you want to copy all the files locally (for the 1st time or when you've deleted the project directory) to grab your own copy of
openstrat from github git clone <a href="https://github.com/Richtype/openstrat"></a>
cd openstrat

## pull (make your local copy the same as the master)
# use this to grab the latest copy from github
git pull origin master

## push (when new files have been added locally (by you))
# made some changes and want to send them off to the github master
git add -A    #staging: tell git you've made new files to the project
git commit -m "description of this commit" #describe the changes
git push origin master #now push your local changes to master on the tinternet

## push alternative method (you've only made changes to existing files
# shorthand version of the above BUT wont take into account any new files you may have created
git commit -a -m "description of this commit"  #staging without adding new files
git push origin master #send changes to master so others can enjoy them

## status
# to check the status of your copy of master
git status

## cache user/pswd
# store username/password for a set number of seconds, the next time you push
git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"


### sbt ###
#NB: if you ever have a problem with compiling or building or similar?
#     before turning it of and on again! (joke)
#      its usually worthwhile to run clean once (from the sbt console/terminal) and trying again
#       before trying to figure out why it dont work
clean # give everything a wash removing any gremlins that lurk in these builders
