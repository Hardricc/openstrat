<h1>Contributing to opensource for absolute beginners on Windows</h1>
<p>This is not completely accurate yet.</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>Open a github account. You will just need to create a user name, a password and give an email address</li>
	<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/Richtype/openstrat">https://github.com/Richtype/openstrat</a> and click on the "Fork" button toward the top right of the page</li>
	<li>Go to the home folder (or where ever else you want to create your clone of the project) on your desktop in Windows and open a bash terminal in that folder. And then from that terminal run the following commands:</li>
	<li><span class=cmd>git clone https://github.com/Richtype/openstrat.git</span></li>
	<li><span class=cmd>git branch b<span class=mod>Sarah</span>1</span></li>
	<li>Open the file <span class=file>GitPractice.txt</span> in the editor of your choice. This <span class=file>GitPractice.txt</span> file is created purely for the purpose of practicing pull requests and testing git / github workflows, so you can edit it without worrying about damaging anything important.</li>
	<li>Just add / insert a message where ever you fancy in the file.</li>
    <li>Save this file. Then from the root folder of the project</li>
    <li><span class=cmd>git add Misc/GitPractice.txt</span></li>
    <li><span class=cmd>git commit -m "<span class=mod>Sarah</span>'s first commit"</span></span></li>
    <li><span class=cmd> git push origin master</span></li>
