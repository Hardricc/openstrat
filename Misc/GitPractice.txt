# to grab openstrat from github
git clone https://github.com/Richtype/openstrat
cd openstrat


# use this to grab the latest copy from github
git pull origin master

# the following commands assume you are in the root of openstrat
# cd openstrat

# made some changes and want to commit to the github master
git add -A    //stageing
git commit -m "add your description of the commit here"
git push origin master

# shorthand version of the above BUT wont take into account any new files you may have created
git commit -a -m "fixed links"  //stageing without adding new files
git push origin master


# to check the status of your copy of master
git status
#  >>typical output<<
#  >>>>On branch master
#  >>>>Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
#  >>>>Nothing to commit, working directory clean
