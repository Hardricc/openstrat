/** This is the package for the first example of an extremely simple simultaneous turn tile based game. The game is created purely to illustrate and
 * test fundamental algorithm and software patterns. It is not intended as an interesting game to play. Each Counter can move one hex tile step. Any
 * move to a tile already containing a counter or that one more than one counter is attempting to move to fails. there are hex and square tile
 * versions. The square tile version is identical except that in the square tile world horizontal moves take precedence over perpendicular moves. */
