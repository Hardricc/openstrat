  <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
  <div class=main>
<p>This is just a place to put various notes, so as stuff doesn't get lost. It can be sorted into proper documentation later.</p>

<p>So its been one of my aspirations to reduce if not remove dependence on scala.Any. Any often leads to extra boxing. Single
boxing of AnyRef classes but double boxing of primitives such Int, Double and Boolean. I created an Opt class as a replacement
for Option and started replacing scala.Either[+A, +B] with a lower head Error Monad replacement. However this creates similar
but possibly worse method signature complication than can scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom.</p>

<p>The Opt class certainly works for the A* pathfinding algorithm where it doesn't into the user interface.</p>

<p>So at least recent versions of Kubuntu the java command on the path, is at /usr/bin/java. It is a link to /etc/alternatives/java.
This is also a link. To install a different java, install the JDK root folder in usr/lib/jvm. It doesn't have to be here,
but it makes it easier to go with convention. Run <br>
sudo update-alternatives --config java<br>
In my example this gives<br>
 Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1111      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1111      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
So leave the number as it is, then add to alternatives. I put the number 3 at then end because in my case slots 0 to 2 are
already taken.<br>
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_212/bin/java 3<br>
then repeat sudo update-alternatives --config java

<p>ScalaRx might prove useful. Consider -Xfatal-warnings.</p>
<p>Consider extending hexadecimal to 32 values for succinct tile coordinate notation. Uses all the letters except i and o. 2 digits can encode 1024 vales instead of 100. 3 digits can encode 32768 values instead of a thousand.
