/** This package and module is for Earth maps. In particular the tiling of the whole world in Hex grids, defining the changes over the course of
 *  history. This will be a data orientated module. It will also include terrain types to model terrain, both real and imagined for local maps and
 *  higher scales right up to 0.5 metres per tile However it won't generally include the data for these. The data for the real world will be organised
 *  according to a number of levels, which are likely to change over increasingly shorter historical time frames.
 *
 *  1 Base elevation, relative to 1950 sea level, and relief.
 *  2 Climate.
 *  2 Sea level, shore lines, lake shore lines and river courses.
 *  3 Land-use, both natural and human. */
