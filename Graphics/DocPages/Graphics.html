  <h1>Graphics Module</h1>
  <div class ="main">
    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ostrat.geom A pure or near pure functional package.
    <ul>
      <li>Basic  geometry.</li>
      <li>A number of implementation Value classes of the Int and Double product classes defined in ostrat.</li>
      <li>2d graphical objects for generalised use. They are of particular use for the generic canvas based classes defined in pCanv but can be used
       in any display framework and for printing.</li>
     </ul>
      </li>

      <li> ostrat.pCanv depends on geom. This could be made into a separate module, but I don't see any great advantage.
        <ul>
          <li>Abstract canvas and classes for placing objects on that abstract canvas.</li>
          <li>classes for the manipulation and display of maps.</li>
          <li>Mouse and other abstract controls.</li>
          <li>An implementation of Canvas for Jvm using JavaFx.</li>
          <li>An implementation of Canvas for Html Canvas using JavaScript.</li>
          <li>There is no implementation for Native yet. I'm waiting for Scala-native to get up on 2.12 before experimenting. Running a game server in
            native should pose no problems. However there is no easily accessible canvas for native on Windows or Linux. The abstract canvas api could
            be implemented on DirectX or OpenGL, but this would require significantly more work than for the ScalaFx canvas or the Html Canvas.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
