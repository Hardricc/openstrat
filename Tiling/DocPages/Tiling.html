  <h1>Tiling Module</h1>
  <div class ="main">
    <p>A Module for tiling on hex and square grids and grid systems combining multiple grids. And for using those grid systems in, multi,
     simultaneous, homogenious segment simultaneous turn games and productions.</p>
    <div>
      <h2>Contents</h2>
      <ul>   
        <li>Tile geometry.</li>
        <li>Game Terminology.</li>
        <li>Turn Resolution.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Game Terminology</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>InWorld</b> The game or production universe. Entities within the game universe have no knowledge of entities in the PlayerWorld or the
         OutWorld<</li>
        <li><b>PlayerWorld</b> The assignment of PlayerControl. The time dead lines and time credits for submission of turn Directives. Rules on
         credits from InGame achievements or role-playering accreditation on future assignment of InWorld entities. Rules on Player communication.
       </li>
        <li><b>OutWorld</b> Anything outside of the Player universe. This can include servers, security, payement etc.</li>
        <li><b>Player</b> A PlayerWorld entity. Maybe a human, an AI or a script.</li>
        <li><b>PlayerControl</b> Assignment of an InWorld entity to a Player's control.</li>
        <li><b>Directive</b> A player directive given by a player to an InWorld entity at the begining of a turn.</li>
        <li><b>ControlHeirarchy</b> The precedence order of PlayerControl for Directives if multiple players are given control of an InGame
         entity.</li>
        <li><b>Intention</b> Intention to make an effect by an InGame object. An Intention has a single SourceTile and a single TargetTile.</li>
        <li><b>SourceTile</b> The location of an entity making an Intention.</li>
        <li><b>TargetTile</b> The target an Intention. Maybe the sourceTile. For some Intentions it must be an adjacent tile for others it maybe a non
          adjacent tile.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Turn Resolution</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Verify directives from Players are valid and under the PlayerControl</li>
        <li>Resolve ControlHeirarchy</li>
        <li>Map Directives to intentions. In more complex games some Directives maybe ignored or defered by InGame Objects.</li>
        <li>Aggregate Intentions.</li>
        <li>Add subsidary Intentions.</li>
        <li>Resolve Segment
          <ul>
            <li>Accumulate. Aggregate the intentions in their TargetTiles.</li>
            <li>Ajudicate. Determine the outcome of the Intentions and processes.</li>
            <li>Consolidate. Create a new game state from the outcomes of the Intentions on the TargetTile. No Movement is implemented during this
              stage.</li>
            <li>Distribute. Distribute the movement effects of the resolution of the TargetTiles on the SourceTiles in the Consilidated Game State.
              Moving entities from SourceTiles to TargetTiles when appropriate.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat Resolve Segement till the given number of segments has been repeated.</li>
        <li>Inform the players, human and AI, of the Turn resolution.</li>
      </ol>
