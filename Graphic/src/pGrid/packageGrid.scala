/** This package works with hexagonal and Square tile grids. The tile objects themselves will not in the general case the contain grid coordinates, although
 * it may be necessary to include this data for complex Tile values interacting with their wider environment. Its fundamental components are the grid data itself.
 * This is just a linear array of tile data. Compile-time typed grid data. So for example a chess board can be represented by a 64 element Arr, its context
 * determines that it is to be interpreted as an 8 by 8 square grid. Grid descriptions that describe the grid representation in the Array and GridFunctions
 * which implement Cood to T. The grid and grid-gui hierarchies currently contain a mix of new and old systems.
 *
 * The package name pGrid was chosen to allow you to use the name "grid" in your code. */
