/** Simplest multi player game in which you can move one hex per turn. Simplest turn resolution, you can not move into a hex occupied by another
 *  player or into a hex anther player is attempting to move. Compare this to the board game "Diplomacy". The only simultaneous turn board game that
 *  I think of. As Diplomacy was a board game, there was no computer and normally no games master (dungeon master). Hence they tried to keep the turn
 *  resolution system simple. This is way simpler. You only have one piece per player. There's only one type of unit. There's no combat. There's no
 *  supporting of units and there's no terrain.
 *  
 *  Obviously the focus of this project is to have complex multi-segement turn resolution, that was just not possible bofore cheap computers and
 *  networks. However the purpose of this project is isolate the problems of game management from the complexities of turn resolution and turn
 *  resolution display. And to give the simplest example to help beginners build their own simultaneous turn games, reinforcing the mantra that "A
 *  complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked." */
